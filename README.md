# DataCom Calculators
Matt Raymond - MSc University of Michigan, Ann Arbor

# About
The end goal of this project is to create a set of calculators for Chapman
University's DataCom (CPSC 353) class to help students check their work while
learning about various networking algorithms. This will be implemented with
TypeScript and hosted on my personal website, where it will hopefully be a
useful resource for anyone taking DataCom in the future.

My goal levels are as follows:
1. Implement all the algorithms
    - Implement in typescript
    - Perform automated testing using Jest
2. Host algorithms on my website
    - Create basic user interface
    - Make the interface pretty
    - Change anything in the code that makes this step difficult
3. Modify the code to give step-by-step explanations of how to come get the
correct answer
    - This is the ideal, as with paper I often made small mistakes partway
    through computations, and solvers tend to be very helpful in distinguishing
    a copying mistake from a problem with comprehension.

These programs will be released under the GNU license, and people can use them
for whatever they want, no questions asked. However, If you're doing something
interesting with it, feel free to let me know.

As a general note, the testing for TCP Tahoe and Reno would be really
complicated to set up, so I'm going to do it manually once I get the graphing
set up.
